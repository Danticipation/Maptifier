Test categories: Functional (every feature), Performance (fps, memory, battery, thermal), Stress (30-min continuous use, rapid switching, 10+ saves), Edge (airplane mode, low storage, low battery, TalkBack, split-screen), External display (every device + adapter), Lifecycle (home, recent apps, phone call, notification, rotation). Thermal throttling: 30-minute dual-layer + effects in 30-35C ambient simulating stage lights.","- Test report for every device/feature combination
- All target devices pass performance thresholds
- Thermal test shows no crash or sub-30fps drop
- All lifecycle scenarios handled gracefully",8,test,qa,High,QA Engineer,MAPT-TEST
Story,MAPT-TEST,Per-device GPU optimization pass,"Profile every device using Unity Profiler, FrameTimingManager, Android GPU Inspector (Adreno) / ARM Streamline (Mali). Optimize: Adreno (half precision, avoid dependent texture reads, Vulkan), Mali (minimize fragment complexity, avoid discard), PowerVR (tile-based compatibility). Implement GPU capability tiers: Tier 1 full, Tier 2 75% RT, Tier 3 50% RT. Detect via SystemInfo on first launch.","- All target devices meet 60 fps target
- Per-device profiling reports completed
- GPU tiers correctly detected and applied
- Shader analysis clean on Mali Offline Compiler",5,perf,graphics,High,Graphics Dev,MAPT-TEST
Story,MAPT-TEST,Wireless display fallback (Cast/Miracast),"Implement Miracast/Google Cast detection via MediaRouter API. Cast composite RT as media route. Known limitation: Cast has 100-200 ms latency; show warning to user. Test on Chromecast, Miracast-compatible TV, Samsung Smart View.","- Wireless display works as secondary option
- Latency warning shown to user
- Graceful fallback when wired unavailable",5,display,core,Medium,Core Dev Lead,MAPT-TEST
Story,MAPT-TEST,Stability hardening,"Global exception handler: catch unhandled exceptions, log to Crashlytics, show recovery dialog. ANR watchdog: monitor main thread, log if approaching 5s threshold. Audit all async code for exception handling and cancellation. Test with Android 'Don't keep activities' enabled. Pre-warm critical shaders during splash to avoid first-launch compilation stutter (ShaderVariantCollection).","- Crash-free rate > 99.5% in 100 sessions
- No ANR occurrences
- No first-launch shader stutter
- Recovery dialog works for unhandled exceptions",5,core,core,High,Core Dev Lead,MAPT-TEST
Story,MAPT-TEST,Regression testing and visual comparison,Full regression pass after each optimization fix. Automated screenshot comparison for visual regression (capture composite output vs baseline). Verify no visual regressions from optimization changes.,"- Regression suite covers all features
- Visual comparison baseline established
- No regressions introduced by optimization",3,qa,qa,High,QA Engineer,MAPT-TEST
Epic,,MAPT-RELEASE,"Phase 8: Release Preparation and Store Assets — Signed release AAB, Play Store listing (screenshots, feature graphic, description), privacy policy, ProGuard/R8 rules, pre-launch report via Firebase Test Lab, launch checklist.","- AAB passes Play Store pre-launch checks with no critical issues
- AAB size: base APK <= 95 MB + asset packs <= 40 MB (total <= 135 MB installed)
- All store assets meet Play Store requirements
- Privacy policy covers all data collection
- App rated Everyone on IARC content rating",13,release,core,High,Core Dev Lead,
Story,MAPT-RELEASE,Build signed release AAB,"Configure release signing keystore (NOT in repo). ProGuard/R8 rules for Unity, Firebase, reflection-based code. Test release build thoroughly. Enable AAB + Play Asset Delivery for Addressables. Base APK target <= 95 MB, asset packs <= 40 MB. Version 1.0.0 / code 1. Final IL2CPP Release build with stripping. Use [Preserve] attribute / link.xml for reflection targets.","- AAB builds and signs correctly
- Base APK <= 95 MB
- ProGuard/R8 does not break serialization or shader loading
- IL2CPP stripping does not remove needed code",5,release,core,High,Core Dev Lead,MAPT-RELEASE
Story,MAPT-RELEASE,Prepare Play Store listing and assets,"Screenshots (5-8): external display projecting, 4-corner warping, drawing, effects library, dual-layer mixing, project browser, onboarding. Feature graphic: 1024x500 from logo. App icon: 512x512. Short description (80 char): Turn your Android phone into a pocket projection mapper. Full description with features and requirements. Demo video: 30-60 second screen recording.","- All assets meet Play Store size requirements
- Screenshots show key features clearly
- Description is keyword-optimized
- Demo video shows core workflow",3,design,ui,Medium,UI/UX Designer,MAPT-RELEASE
Story,MAPT-RELEASE,Privacy policy and content rating,"Privacy policy page (GitHub Pages): crash logs (Crashlytics), anonymous analytics (Firebase), no PII, no accounts, no ads, data retention policy. IARC content rating questionnaire. Target API level compliance (SDK 34 for 2026 Play Store). Pre-launch report via Firebase Test Lab on 10+ devices.","- Privacy policy published and linked in store listing
- Content rating: Everyone
